      <h3 class="project-section-heading">Problem</h3>
      <p>In an age of constant stimulation and fragmented attention, many individuals struggle to wind down, process their emotions, and align with their inner goals before sleep. While wellness apps offer generic solutions like meditation or journaling, few provide an immersive, personalized nighttime experience that honors the cyclical nature of both the cosmos and the self.</p>

      <h3 class="project-section-heading">Objectives</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Fast Launch Strategy:</strong> The initial release focused on delivering a core product quickly. Feature prioritizations were deferred to post-launch user interviews, allowing real feedback to shape future iterations after providing a physical product for users to engage with.</li>
        <li><strong>Dark-Mode-First Experience:</strong> Create a dark-mode-first experience with soft gradients, subtle animations, and minimal distractions to support a peaceful, end-of-day ritual.</li>
        <li><strong>Lightweight Onboarding:</strong> Use lightweight onboarding and modular navigation to align rituals with each user's chart, offering structure without friction.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessible Mystical Content:</strong> Make complex astrological and subconscious information feel accessible through visual tools like moon wheels, dream cards, and guided prompt modals.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="project-section-heading">Summary</h3>
      <p><strong>Circadia</strong> is a bedtime app that helps you wind down with astrology, dream journaling, and manifestation rituals, all synced to the moon. It mixes personalized prompts, a Rorschach-style unconscious test, and gentle guidance to help you reflect, set intentions, and tap into your intuitive side. The vibe is mystical but grounded, with a calming design that makes everything feel easy, not like another self-help app. Circadia brings together astrology, psychology, and nightly rituals to create a more meaningful way to end your day.</p>

      <h3 class="project-section-heading">Key Responsibilities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed the core concept and vision for the app, combining astrology, manifestation, and subconscious exploration</li>
        <li>Defined key features such as dream journaling, zodiac-based guidance, and Rorschach-inspired prompts</li>
        <li>Designed intuitive user flows that support a reflective, nighttime experience</li>
        <li>Created custom icons and visual assets to align with the app's mystical theme</li>
        <li>Currently building Rive animations to enhance micro interactions and reinforce calming user engagement</li>
        <li>Prioritized a dark-mode-first UI for immersive nighttime use</li>
        <li>Integrated symbolic and astrological data into clear, accessible visual components</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="project-section-heading">User Flow</h3>
      <p>This user flow journey map helped shape <em>Circadia's</em> UI by clarifying the app's core interactions before any mockups were made. It allowed the founders to visualize the sequence of user actions, identify key decision points, and ensure the experience felt cohesive and intentional from the start.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Manifestation Guide Flow:</strong> Users receive astrology-based guidance tailored to the moon phase and their birth chart to support intentional manifestation before sleep.</li>
        <li><strong>Unconscious Test Flow:</strong> Users are prompted to explore their unconscious by responding to a Rorschach-style inkblot image, submitting their interpretation for later analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Unconscious Report Flow:</strong> After a delay, users receive a detailed report analyzing their inkblot interpretation through psychological and astrological lenses, including alignment with their manifestation goal.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification & Re-engagement Flow:</strong> Users are notified when their unconscious report is ready, leading them back into the app to revisit and reflect on their test results and personalized insights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="project-section-heading">Design System</h3>
      <p>A lightweight design system was created after aligning on branding direction with the founders. It was kept intentionally flexible, with minimal constraints, knowing that the visual language and components would continue to evolve post-launch.</p>

      <h3 class="project-section-heading">Current Status</h3>
      <p>Circadia is currently in development and expected to launch on the App Store in the coming months. I'm continuing to support the team with Rive animations and design assistance. Once the app is deployed, I'll begin the next phase of UX research to guide future iterations.</p>

      <h3 class="project-section-heading">Professional Takeaways</h3>
      <div class="project-body">
        <p><strong>Design can be flexible.</strong> A fast launch was a business requirement, and I used it to shape a focused design strategy. I kept the solution minimal and easy to build so we could launch quickly and learn directly from users. Prioritizing feedback on features instead of over-designing in isolation.</p>
